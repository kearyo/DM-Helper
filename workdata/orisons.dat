Color 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd.
By use of this cantrip, the caster brings color to an object. It can be used to restore faded hues or to tinge those already colored with a different hue. Thus, dull or faded fabric can be brightened, pigments restored, or even hair or skin changed to another color. The effect must be renewed every 30 days. Verbal component is a humming, somatic is a back-and-forth or wringing hand motion.

Aspiration 
(Invocation) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: 0        Casting Time: 1 segments       Duration: 6 turns        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Caster
An aspiration is a quick prayer on the order of, "Give me strength!" or "Don’t let me goof up!" In game terms, it permits a nervous player to pre-roll a dice roll. The player-caster rolls a d20 out of the player’s own sight for the DM, who records it. At any time during the next game hour, the caster may appeal to have a bad die roll replaced by the hidden roll. The d20 can be applied as a "to hit" roll, a saving throw, or, by multiplying it by live, a percentile dice roll. Upon the caster’s request, whatever was rolled in casting the orison is revealed, and becomes the official dice roll. There is no guarantee that the previous roll will be better, but it will be a second chance. The somatic component is the caster’s ritual sign. 

Benediction 
(Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible 
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: 1"        Casting Time: 2 segments       Duration: 2 rounds        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1" x 1" square
A benediction is a minor form of bless, raising morale of friendly creatures by +1, and their hit probability by + 1. It will not affect those already engaged in combat. It requires no material component. 

Candle 
(Alteration; clerical only) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S, M     Range: Touch        Casting Time: 1 segments       Duration: 2 turns        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 candle
When casting this orison, the caster causes the candle held in his hand to light. Throughout the orison’s duration, the candle cannot be put out as long as the caster continues to hold it. The candle will be consumed normally, but drafts, gusts of wind, and so on cannot extinguish the flame. Drowning or smothering the flame will extinguish it, however. 

Canticle 
(Alteration) 
Level: 99        Components: V     Range: 0        Casting Time: Special       Duration: Special        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Caster
A canticle is a minor form of sanctuary, and casting it requires the chanting of portions of the cleric’s sacred literature. As long as the chanting continues, opponents must make a saving throw at +2 in order to strike or otherwise attack the caster. The caster cannot engage in any other activity than slow movement (6" rate) during this time. For other effects, see the description of the sanctuary spell. 

Ceremony: Oath
(Conj./Summoning; clerical only) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S, M     Range: Touch        Casting Time: 3 segments       Duration: Special        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 person of the caster’s religion 
A person taking an oath in the presence of a cleric pledges his honor to do some minor task. The cleric proffers his holy symbol for both parties involved in the oath to touch, and ratifies the oath with his ritual sign and some formula such as "so be it". The oath stands until the pledge is fulfilled or broken. If broken, the oath taker (whether the cleric himself or some other person of the cleric’s religion) will lose -5% on his loyalty base until satisfactory reparations are made (if ever). Note that a third party of the caster’s religion can pledge his honor for the oath of a nonbeliever. In this case, both join in touching the cleric’s holy symbol while the orison is cast. The cleric can pledge his own honor for a non-believer, but this is an extremely rare circumstance. The penalty to loyalty base simulates the loss of honor to the oath breaker. 

Cure Minor Wounds
(Necromantic) 
Level: 99        Components: V,S (plus M for druids)     Range: Touch        Casting Time: 2 segments       Duration: Permanent        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Character touched 
A minor cure, similar to all other cure spells, this orison will heal 1-4 hit points of damage. Note that this spell is not reversible. See the cure light wounds description for more information. 

Find a Stray
(Divination; druidical only) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S, M     Range: 2 miles        Casting Time: 3 segments       Duration: Special        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 domestic animal and the caster
This orison enables the caster to locate any missing domestic animal within two miles. The animal could be a cow, sheep, dog, horse, cat, or any other such normal beast. The caster stands in a place well-known to the animal (a barnyard, pasture, etc.), spits on the ground, makes a sign, and calls the animal by name (Rover, Buttercup, Porky, Old Tom, etc.). If the animal is within two miles of the caster, the caster’s tongue will tingle slightly, and give him direction by the manner of its tingling as to where and about how far off the animal is. The effects will last until the animal is found, the caster gives up, or the animal moves beyond a two-mile distance from the caster. 

Malediction 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: 1"        Casting Time: 2 segments       Duration: 2 rounds        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1" x 1" square
The reverse of benediction, malediction will lower the morale of opponents by a -1 penalty and lower their "to hit" scores by -1. It does not affect those already engaged in combat. No material components are required. 

Meditation
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Touch        Casting Time: 3 segments       Duration: 1 turn        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Caster
A minor (and non-reversible) form of remove fear, a meditation is an orison of personal encouragement that gives the caster (and only the caster) a +2 on all saving throws vs. the various sorts of magical fear attacks for 1 turn. 

Petition
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Special        Casting Time: 1 segments       Duration: 1 day        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: Caster's patron
Petitions are a staple of all prayers, in all religions. Most favors asked of one’s deity are answered in terms of lucky dice rolls and other game mechanics. This orison constitutes a direct appeal of a very limited nature to the caster’s deity or other patron. If the deity or patron fails his or her saving throw (2 for gods and demigods, 3 for heroes in the Legends & Lore book), the request will be heard, and if it’s not too much trouble, some minion or servant of the deity might act upon it. Examples of such minor petitions are to find something minor, meet someone, remember something forgotten, make a favorable impression, and so on. A petition is only good for one day. If it is not granted that day, or if no opportunity for its granting comes up, it is wasted, and another petition must be made the next day. Any attempt to abuse this orison with powerful requests ("Oh, please let me find a ring of three wishes!") will be met with divine punishment if it is heard. Punishment may consist of a loss of spell-casting power, hit points, or other power or ability, as desired by the DM. However, punishments are rarely severe or last long unless the caster is guilty of multiple abuses. 

Ripen 
(Alteration; druidical only) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S, M     Range: Touch        Casting Time: 2 segments       Duration: Permaneny        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 lb. of fruit
By casting this orison, the user causes unripe fruit to ripen. The material component is the druid’s mistletoe, oak leaves, or holly berries. 

Warding 
(Abjuration) 
Level: 99        Components: V, S, M     Range: Touch        Casting Time: 2 segments       Duration: 2 rounds        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Creature touched
This orison is a very minor form of protection from evil. For two rounds, it will prevent enchanted, conjured, or summoned creatures from making bodily contact with the recipient, by encircling him or her with magical protection at a distance of one foot. However, it gives no penalty to any attacks that do not involve such contact, and adds no bonuses to one’s saving throws. To complete the spell, the caster sprinkles holy water on the recipient.
