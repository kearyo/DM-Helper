Color 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd.
By use of this cantrip, the caster brings color to an object. It can be used to restore faded hues or to tinge those already colored with a different hue. Thus, dull or faded fabric can be brightened, pigments restored, or even hair or skin changed to another color. The effect must be renewed every 30 days. Verbal component is a humming, somatic is a back-and-forth or wringing hand motion.

Dampen 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd.
When a cantrip of this sort is cast, the subject area is permeated by a fog-like dampness which leaves all material within it damp to the touch. It is useful for many sorts of things. It is hard on parchment, and it similarly makes it and like substances hard to set aflame. Those within the area of effect of the dampen cantrip will be enwrapped in a light fog, and objects in this fog, while still visible, will lose their detail. Verbal component is a low hooting or a hummed ditty, somatic is a hand gesture upwards with writhing fingers.

Dry 
(Abjuration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd.
This cantrip removes dampness and excess moisture from materials within the area of effect. It is useful for cloth, herbs, and cleaning chores. Verbal component is similar to that of the dampen cantrip, and the somatic is a two-handed wringing motion. 

Dust 
(Abjuration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 10’ radius
A cantrip of this sort removes all fine dust and tiny grit particles from exposed surfaces such as floors, shelves, walls, etc. The material so removed is transported elsewhere, but new dust can accumulate, of course. Verbal component is a continuous in-drawing of breath, somatic is a back-and-forth hand motion.

Exterminate 
(Abjuration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 small creature
When this cantrip is used, the caster may kill a small pest such as a fly, mouse, rat, beetle, or the like. It is useful for indoor and outdoor applications. If the subject is very small, an area of up to 1/2 cubic foot can be rid of pests. This cantrip is effective against magical creations and normal-sized creatures magically shrunk to insect-size, but has no effect on polymorphed creatures and similarly enchanted beings. The somatic gesture is a pointed finger, while the caster verbalizes a low zzzt sound.

Flavor (Enchantment)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This cantrip enables the caster to give the subject a superior or better or different flavor. Thus, mush can be made to taste as if it were lobster bisque, but the dweomer will not actually affect quality or wholesomeness. Spoiled food remains spoiled; a poisoned drink would still be deadly (though any tell-tale taste of the poison may be masked in this fashion). The verbal component is a muttered lip-smacking sound; the somatic gesture is a shaking motion.

Freshen 
(Enchantment)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
By means of this cantrip, the caster brings new life or freshness to the object desired. The magic applies to food and drink items such as milk, beer, meat, and raw vegetables. It also works with cut vegetables, flowers, herbs, etc. Although it will remove a slight taint of spoilage, restore drooping flowers, and so on, it is not as effective as a purify food & drinkspell, and it lasts for but an hour. The subject must be of relatively small size, i.e. a small cask of liquid, a sheep, a bushel of vegetables, etc. If used on a creature that is harmed by magics such as purify food & drink, the cantrip inflicts 1-4 points of damage. The verbal component is an mmmmmm sound, while the hand makes a mystic symbol with thumb and forefinger forming a circle and the other fingers upright and apart.

Gather 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 sq. yd.
This cantrip enables the caster to neatly gather numerous small objects into a stack or pile. For instance, if nails, nuts, coins, papers, or like objects were spilled, the magic would bring them together. It can be used selectively, for instance to separate one type of material from another, but only the selected type would be gathered neatly. The caster verbalizes the type of material to be gathered while making a gathering motion.

Polish 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
When this cantrip is used, the caster magically smooths and brings a luster to materials such as wood, metal, stone, leather, or ceramic. Naturally, the desired object must be relatively clean in order for the cantrip to be effective. The object affected must be of reasonable size -a floor of up to 1,000 square feet, an armoire, etc. It works better on smaller objects, of course, such as boots, mirrors, crystal containers, etc. The caster hums a ditty while making a buffing motion.

Salt
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This cantrip causes a sprinkling of fine salt to magically appear and descend upon the desired object - a stew, some troublesome weed patch, or a barrel full of stock fish to be preserved. The object must be of a reasonable size - up to perhaps 4 square yards in area or about 30 gallons liquid volume. Care must be taken to avoid over-salting if the object involved is smaller, and if the object is larger, it will not receive much salt. Creatures adversely affected by salt (such as a giant slug) take 1-4 points of damage from this cantrip. The verbal component is a labial smacking, performed while the hand makes a sprinkling motion.

Shine 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
Similar to the polish cantrip, this magic allows the caster to remove tarnish, rust, corrosion, and similar substances from the desired object. This cantrip brings about a mirror-bright shine to objects capable of such, causing their surfaces to be smooth and unmarred. A piece of jewelry, for instance, would be made more attractive, and the gems (only) of such a piece might be actually made more valuable: If base value of the gem(s) in a piece of jewelry was originally decreased, and a shine cantrip is used upon the object, then the owner may (if desired) find out whether the value of the gem(s) has been changed. (The DM should roll again on the (Increase or Decrease of Worth Beyond Base Value) table on page 26 of the DMG, with a -1 modifier to the die roll.) No gem can be re-valued in this manner more than once. A single object up to about 1 cubic yard in volume can be treated by this cantrip. Its components are similar to those of polish.

Spice
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
Unlike the flavor cantrip, this magic actually brings a particular spice to the object of food or drink. Thus, ginger, pepper, and like spices can be brought to add zest (or disguise). Herbs such as bay leaf, garlic, parsley, and so forth can likewise be evoked by this cantrip. The quantity is sufficient to spice food or drink for about a dozen people. The spice (or herb) appears over the object vessel as a fine powder or flake, falls upon it, and adds its substance to the dish or drink. A ditty is hummed for the verbal component, while the hand makes a crumbling and sprinkling motion.

Sprout
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd.
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes acceleration in the growth of plants, particularly with respect to the germination of plant seeds. Upon its casting, the cantrip will cause seeds to shoot forth tiny sprouts, newly sprouted plants to grow an inch or so, buds to flower, etc. Fruits and vegetables can be caused to ripen (or actually go past ripening to spoilage) by this cantrip. A susurrant sound is verbalized while the caster’s hand makes hoeing motions.

Stitch
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
This cantrip magically sews seams in cloth or leather. It will make new ones, or repair old work. About 20 yards of cloth can be thus stitched, but only about 2 yards of leather. The seam thus created is neither stronger nor weaker than a seam done without magic. Usually a brief rhyme is recited as the hand makes a sewing motion. 

Sweeten 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This cantrip is the same as a spice cantrip, except that the result is the  evocation of a sweetener - sugar, honey, or even a syrup. Components are a buzzing sound and a stirring motion.

Tie 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
By means of this cantrip, the caster can magically cause the object of the magic - thread, string, cord, rope, or even cable - to tightly knot itself to either its other end or an end of a similar object within 1' of it. The resulting knot will be a normal one such as a square knot, halfhitch, running bowline, or whatever other sort is desired. The caster verbalizes the name of the knot while holding up three fingers.

Warm 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1' cube
This cantrip is the same as chill, except that the magic brings a warming of the liquid or solid. The temperature will rise at most about 40° F. The cantrip will never cause living creatures to become warmer than their normal body temperature. Components are an aah sound vocalized while the hands are rubbed briskly together.

Wrap 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd.
When a wrap cantrip is employed, the caster creates a strong and sturdy wrapping around the subject desired - a bit of herbs, a heap of flour, a bundle of cloth, etc. The material of the cantrip is of a suitable type and thickness for the item(s) to be wrapped. Thus, a few ounces of fine powder will be contained in a waxy tissue, gem stones in a felt-like envelope, meal in cloth, and so forth. The wrapping can be undone normally, but the caster can just as easily order it to open, so the cantrip is often used to enfold the material components of a spell. The caster verbalizes a general class of wrapping desired while making folding motions with his hands.

Curdle 
(Enchantment)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This cantrip is broader than its name, for it affects many food and drink items. The magic curdles milk and hastens spoilage or wilting, but does not putrefy food & drink as per that spell. It has a permanent effect on the object. It is otherwise similar to freshen. The caster verbalizes a retching sound while pointing the thumb downward.

Dirty 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 4 sq. yds.
The opposite of a clean cantrip, this enables the caster to soil, spot, and sully walls, floors, dishes, garments, etc. Verbal component is a spitting sound, made while the feet are shuffled and stamped.

Dusty 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 10' radius
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes a film of dust and grime to settle upon all exposed surfaces within the cantrip area of effect. The verbal component is a low humming sound, made while the hands move in shaking motions.

Hairy 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
While this cantrip is not actually one of the standard usefulones which apprentices reverse for mischievousness, it is one which is generally used for no good purpose. It causes hair, fur, or hairlike growth to thicken and lengthen. Thus, a head of hair, a peach, a beard, a cat, or whatever could be affected. The growth will cause the subject material to increase from 2-12 inches in length. The subject material must be trimmed or cut to remove the cantrip's effect. This cantrip can be reversed to shorten growth or effectively shave, but since the effect on short material (growth under 1 inch in length) is complete absence of growth for 2-12 days, it is not often used. The caster verbalizes snicking sounds while making massaging motions for growth, or scissoring motions for removal.

Knot 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This cantrip is a permutation of the tie cantrip. It causes the thread, string, cord, or rope to knot itself in such a manner as to be very difficult to untie, and from 2-8 rounds, minus dexterity bonus for reaction of the individual untying the knot, to undo. It works even on material already affected by a tie cantrip, but not on magical ropes, ropes being held onto by a character or creature, or taut lines such as a bowstring. The caster verbalizes a low zzzz sound while moving the arm forward with a strong wrist motion.

Ravel 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
This cantrip is the reverse of astitch. It will work only if there is a loose or broken thread in the seam or fabric to be affected, except for material magically stitched by the appropriate cantrip. When the latter sort of seam or material is involved, the ravel cantrip will always work except in a case where the subject is otherwise magical, i.e. a bag of holding, a cloak of protection, boots of elvenkind, etc. The name of the cantrip is verbalized while the fingers make a plucking motion.

Sour 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
When this cantrip is used, the caster causes the subject food or drink to take on a sour taste, not unlike vinegar of the appropriate sort. While it is typically used to spoil wine, beer, or some pastry, the sour cantrip can be used to useful purpose. The magic actually causes about a pint (maximum) of vinegar to appear over the subject. This can be an empty container in which such liquid is desired. The caster purses the lips and makes a whoosh sound while clenching the hand.

Spill 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One container
The opposite of a gather cantrip, this enables the caster to cause the contents of a container to spill out. The object container is actually tipped by the cantrip, and since the magic is not powerful, containers of more than about gallon size, or magical ones, will not be affected by the cantrip. Solids andlor liquids within the object container will spill out, if the container is not securely closed or capped. To bring about the magic, the caster verbalizes an uh-oh sound while making an abrupt hand motion.

Tangle 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
A permutation of the tie cantrip, this magic allows the caster to cause fine material such as thread, hair, small grass, and the like to become twisted and entwined in a tangle. It will not work on heavy material such as rope. Untangling subject material will take 3-12 rounds, unless it is roughly done - and the material is broken and snapped in the process, torn loose, etc. The cantrip will tangle mixed materials such as grass and string, hair and threads, and so forth. A buzzing is verbalized while the finger makes a stirring motion.

Tarnish 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
The reverse of a shine cantrip, this causes a covering of rust, corrosion, verdigris, or the like to cover an object normally subject to such tarnishing. The object must be of about 1 cubic yard or less in volume. Verbal component is a spitting sound, while the hand makes a sprinkling motion.

Untie 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1 segment       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This permutation of a tie cantrip is simply the reverse of the magic. The caster selects an object - thread, string, cord, etc. - which is knotted or tied. The cantrip removes the knot or tying. Note that the untie cantrip will cause a tangle to be nullified. The cantrip will not remove both a knot and a normal tying (normal knot or one caused by a tie cantrip), but it will cause the former to disappear so that only a normal tying remains. This cantrip has no effect on magical objects. Somatic and verbal components vary according to the desired result. In general, a popping sound is made while the hands are moved apart - either as if a knot were being untied or a cord snapped.

Wilt 
(Enchantment)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
A reverse of the freshen cantrip which affects only vegetable material -whether growing or picked. Thus, a plant can be made to wilt (or possibly wither if it is not very healthy), or a bunch of cut flowers sag or droop. Verbal component is a descending hum, while the forefinger is slowly curled from an upright position.

Change 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
By means of a change cantrip, the caster alters one small object to another, although the change must be within the same kingdom, and only animal and vegetable objects are affected. Thus, a piece of parchment can be changed to a brightly colored cloth square, then the cloth can be changed to a rose by another use of the cantrip. Likewise, a bird can be changed into a bat, the bat to a flying squirrel by another use of the same type of cantrip, and so forth. Each change requires a change cantrip. The cantrip will not cause more than a 50% incease or decrease in size/volume, and the effect will last for a base time of 1 turn. If the change is radical, then the time will be reduced accordingly; Le., changing a dead object to a live one is a radical change and will last only 1 round. On the other hand, a very slight alteration such as color change or the like will last for l or more days. A saving throw against this magic does not apply as long as small, animal-intelligence, non-magical creatures of normal sort are concerned. Typically, a magic word is verbalized while the hand makes a pass over the object to be affected.

Distract
(Enchantment)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/3 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: Special
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes all who are watching to look at an area of the caster’s choice. The area must be to the right or left of the caster, and the distraction must be within 10 feet of the caster. Thus, the caster can cause viewers to watch his or her right hand and a location a few feet distant where the caster’s finger is pointing, while the caster’s left hand does something unnoticed. Saving throws apply only to individuals above 0 level, or with at least 1 + 1 hit dice and an intelligence rating of greater than low. The distract cantrip has a duration of only 1 segment. The caster speaks an attention-getting word or phrase and gestures to the left or right to effectuate the cantrip.

Hide 
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
This cantrip allows the caster to magically hide an object of virtually any size for a short period of time. The cantrip casts a dweomer over the desired object so that it becomes invisible to all who are in front of the caster. Note that the magic does not affect sound, so that if a crowing rooster were made to seemingly disappear, the noise of its cry would still be heard. Likewise, if an elephant were hidden by the cantrip, the sound of its tread, trumpeting, or even breathing might be heard. The dweomer will not work if viewers are beside or behind the caster. The cantrip lasts for 1 turn on an object of 2 cubic yards or less in volume. The duration is reduced by 1 round for every additional 2 cubic yards of volume made to seemingly disappear, until at 20 cubic yards of volume, the duration is 1 round. At over 20 cubic yards of volume, duration is reduced by 1 segment per 2 additional cubic yards; i.e., the hide cantrip will have a duration of 9 segments if cast on an object of 22 cubic yards volume; 8 segments for 24 cubic yards, 7 segments for 26, 6 for 28, 5 for 30,4 for 32, 3 for 34,2 for 36, and 1 segment for 38 cubic yards. Anything over 38 cubic yards in volume will at best momentarily disappear and then reappear again. Verbal component is an activating word such as abracadabra while the hand makes a pass across the forepart of the object. The caster can dispel the cantrip simply by speaking the activating word

Mute 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One object
The mute cantrip allows the caster to alter the shape of small objects of a mineral nature. The magic is effective against glass, metal, stone, etc. A plane can be altered to a rod, a torus to a sphere, etc. Thus, a coin could be changed to be a ring. Similarly, glass could be changed to crystal, lead to silver, copper to gold, etc. However, the dweomers of magical items are too strong for this cantrip to affect them. The duration of the mute is but 1 round. If another individual actually touches the object affected, the dweomer of the cantrip might be affected: The individual touching it makes a saving throw versus spell, and if it succeeds the cantrip is dispelled. The components for the mute cantrip are similar to those of a change cantrip.

Palm 
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One small item
This cantrip enables the caster to secret a small object in his hand without seeming to do so. The dweomer creates an illusory duplicate of the object to be palmed, so that the other can be taken while under a form of hide cantrip (which actually works regardless of viewer position). The illusory duplicate of the palmed object lasts but 1 segment, so it must be covered or screened from view, or else any onlookers will see it wink out of existence. A special word is spoken while a digit points at the object to be palmed. The caster may then pick up the now-invisible actual object while seemingly only touching or handling the illusory duplicate.

Present 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One small item
A present cantrip enables the caster to bring any small object or series of objects from within a 2-foot radius of his or her person to his or her hand. The object or objects will appear magically in the caster’s hand as he or she puts the hand upward or outward with a flourish and speaks the key word to begin the dweomer. If an object as large as a tankard is thus presented, the cantrip will be exhausted, but as many as a dozen coins could be brought to the hand before the dweomer failed. The caster must know the exact nature and location of the object or objects to be presented. If they are on the person of another individual, a saving throw versus spell applies to the individual, unless the object or objects are in plain sight.

Scratch 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One creature
A scratch cantrip causes the subject creature to experience an annoying itch on some portion of the body. Unless a saving throw is successful, the subject will involuntarily scratch at this itch. This ,scratching will take but a second, and will immediately cause the itch to cease. Verbal component is the name of some body pest (flea, louse, etc.), uttered while the area of the itch is pointed to.

Belch 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One person
When this cantrip is cast, the subject will involuntarily belch. A saving throw is applicable only to see how loud or muffled the burping is, failure indicating a very loud belch, success meaning that the sound is relatively low and muffled. The verbal component is an almost inaudible belch, done at the same time that the caster’s hand presses his or her diaphragm.

Blink 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One person
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes the subject person (or creature) to blink his, her, or its eye or eyes. The blinking reaction is only momentary, of course, lasting no more than half a second. A successful saving throw indicates only a single eye wink, or no effect for one-eyed creatures. The verbal component is a softly spoken magical word (such as hat-cha-cha), voiced while the caster snaps his fingers.

Cough 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One person
This cantrip enables the caster to make the subject individual cough spasmodically. If a saving throw is made, the cough is only a brief hacking which will not usually disturb other activities. Failing the saving throw indicates the victim is affected by a loud and active series of coughs lasting from 1 to 3 seconds. The somatic component is a gagging gesture while a gasp is verbalized.

Giggle 
(Charm)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/3 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One person
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes the subject individual to involuntarily giggle. The loudness and length of this reaction depend on the saving throw. If the subject fails to save, the result will be a chuckle or giggle lasting about 2 or 3 seconds. If the save succeeds, only a brief chuckle will be caused. The verbal component is a single word or phrase (known in magical circles as a 'punch line') to be spoken while one finger is moved back and forth rapidly.

Nod 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One person
This cantrip causes the subject to give an involuntary nod of the head due to muscle contraction. The effect is as if the subject were nodding in agreement or as a greeting. A successful saving throw negates the effect. The caster gives a slight nod of the head while pointing his or her small finger at the subject.

Sneeze 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One creature
A cantrip of this nature causes an irritation in the nasal passages of the subject. Unless the subject makes a successful saving throw versus spell, a sneeze will occur. This single sneeze will relieve the irritation. The caster verbalizes the name of an irritant substance while touching his or her nose.

Twitch 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/3 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One creature
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes a muscle contraction in some portion of the subject creature’s appendages - head, neck, hand, arm, foot, leg, etc. The twitch will be noticeable, but will not cause the subject great discomfort or loss of control or concentration. The cantrip is negated by a successful saving throw. Verbal component is the name of the area to be affected while the caster gazes at the area and makes a twitching motion with the hand.

Wink 
(Enchantment)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One person
This cantrip enables the caster to cause the subject individual to wink one eye. A saving throw indicates that the winking is rapid and not greatly noticeable, while failure to save indicates a greatly exaggerated, prolonged winking. The caster speaks a magical phrase (such as twenty-three skidoo) while making an imperceptible winking of his or her eye.

Yawn 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: Negates       Area of Effect: One creature
A yawn cantrip makes the subject creature feel a brief wave of drowsiness which in turn evokes a yawn reaction. If a saving throw versus spell succeeds, the subject creature is totally unaffected by the dweomer of the cantrip. Failure, however, not only forces a yawn to immediately occur, but the subject is then more susceptible to a sleep spell. During the balance of the round in which the yawn cantrip was cast, and during the whole of the following round, the subject will automatically fall into comatose slumber from a sleep spell cast upon it, so 1 additional creature will be vulnerable to the spell if more than 1 creature of 4 or fewer hit dice are subjected to the spell. Further, if creatures of 4 + 1 to 4 + 4 hit dice are involved, there is then a chance that two such creatures will actually be affected by sleep. Even a creature of up to 5 + 2 hit dice can be affected by sleep if previously victimized by a yawn cantrip, but the effect of the sleep spell is rolled for as if the creature had 4 + 1 to 4 + 4 hit dice; Le., there is a 50% chance that it will not be affected. The caster hums a lullaby for the verbal component while making a rocking motion with cupped hands.

Bee 
(Summoning)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One bee
When this cantrip is used, the caster summons a honey bee from someplace -where is of no importance, for the creature appears in seconds. The bee will appear in whatever spot the caster is gazing at, up to 1" distance from him or her. The bee is, of course, annoyed, and it is 90% likely to sting any living creature it finds itself upon. (This will certainly cause the subject to react violently if it would otherwise be so affected by a bee sting.) The verbal component is a low buzzing sound, made while the caster moves a forefinger through flight-like passes.

Bluelight 
(Conjuration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: l/4' diam. sphere
This cantrip enables the caster to conjure a small sphere of glowing blue radiance. The light has an eerie effect when seen from a distance, but the 3-inch sphere only illuminates an area of 5' around itself. Furthermore, the bluelight does not cast reflections beyond this radius. The light does not affect either infravision or ultravision. When the caster says a rhyme using the words blue and light in any combination, the bluelight appears in his or her open palm and remains aglow until the caster ceases to concentrate on it.

Bug 
(Summoning)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One bug
A variation of the bee cantrip, the bug cantrip enables the caster to summon some form of crawling insect. The beetle or bug appears in the same manner as the bee summoned by the cantrip of that name. It will likewise be irritated and will pinch, bite, or otherwise attack the creature it might find itself upon, with appropriate results. Verbal component is the name of the insect desired while the caster's forefinger makes a sliding and pointing motion at the desired area of the bug's appearance (up to 1 " distant).

Firefinger 
(Alteration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/3 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1/2' line
The firefinger cantrip enables the caster to cause a jet of flame up to one-half foot in length to shoot forth from his or her finger. The flame is very hot and will ignite combustible materials such as parchment, twigs, kindling, and the like without difficulty, providing the materials are relatively dry. The flame persists for up to 1 segment. To bring about the magic of this cantrip, the caster speaks a word of power over elemental fire (such as ron-son, zip-Po, or the much revered word, dun-hill), extends the forefinger, and makes a sideways motion with the thumb.

Gnats 
(Summoning)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot
A cantrip of this nature is similar to the bee and bug cantrips described above, except that when it is used a cloud of gnats is summoned. The swarm will immediately proceed to fly around the head of the nearest living creature (which must be no more than 1" from the caster), and unless this creature makes a successful saving throw versus poison, the cloud of gnats will distract the creature for from 1-4 segments before the gnats fly elsewhere. The verbal component is a high-pitched buzzing sound made with the tongue and upper palate while the caster points a digit at the area in which the gnat cloud is to appear.

Mouse
(Summoning)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One mouse
Similar to the cantrip which summons a bee or a bug, the mouse cantrip enables the caster to bring forth a mouse up to 1" from his or her position. The animal will be a typical field mouse or as similar a species as possible. When it arrives, the caster will have no control over the mouse, and the animal will behave as would any mouse in the given situation. The caster speaks a summoning word (typically the name of a food desirable by mice) while holding his or her hands in such a way as to resemble mouse ears.

Smokepuff 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/3 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1' diam. cloud
When this cantrip is employed, a puff of actual smoke appears in the desired location, up to 1" distant from the caster, and will ascend as would a normal cloud of smoke, or be dissipated, depending on the prevailing conditions. The caster can cause the smoke to be either white, gray, black, brown, yellow, or green. The caster names the color of smoke desired while moving a hand from an extended horizontal position to a vertical one, meanwhile breathing forth a puff of air.

Spider
(Summoning)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One spider
This cantrip, much as does a bee or bug or mouse or gnats cantrip, summons a small, ordinary spider from elsewhere to the location desired by the caster, up to l" distant from his or her person. The arachnid so summoned will usually be a common garden spider or the like, no larger than an inch or two in diameter, and basically harmless. There is a 5% chance that the creature will turn out to be one with powerful poison (black widow, brown recluse, etc.). Since the spider summoned will be annoyed, the creature upon which it finds itself, if such is the case, will be subject to an immediate bite attack. This will have only a momentary effect, distracting the victim for 1 segment, for a normal spider. If the spider is of the very poisonous sort, the victim must also make a saving throw versus poison at + 4. Success indicates 1 point of damage is inflicted. Failure indicates 2 points of damage are inflicted, and the victim will feel sick and be unable to act normally for 1-4 days unless a neutralize poison spell is cast to remove the toxin. (A slow poison will defer the sickness for 1 day.) To cast the cantrip, the caster speaks the word arachnid while spreading his or her fingers and wiggling them.

Tweak
(Conjuration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/3 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One creature
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes an unseen thumb and forefinger to harmlessly, but annoyingly, tweak some portion of a chosen subject within a 1" radius of the caster. Portions subject to the tweak cantrip are: cheek, nose, ear, beard, moustache, whiskers, or tail. The cantrip's effects do not disturb spell casting, although the tweaking might distract any creature by causing it to turn to discover the source of the annoyance. A failure to save versus spell (with respect to creatures with an intelligence under 7), or failure to roll a score greater than intelligence on 3d6 (with respect to creatures with intelligence of 7 or greater), indicates a 1-segment distraction. The caster speaks a magic phrase (such as kitchy-kitchy-coo) while making a pinching and pulling motion with thumb and forefinger.
Casting Time: l/3 segment

Unlock 
(Conjuration)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/2 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: One lock
This cantrip enables the caster to conjure an invisible, key-like force appropriate to the locking mechanism to be opened (or closed). The unlock cantrip will affect only simple locks of the most basic sort - typically those which have closing pressure prongs or bolt and pins, or bolt and spring closures. Locks with tumblers or levers, as well as secret-combination locks, are not subject to this cantrip. Note that simple locks with complex wards to prevent skeleton-key triggering will be subject to an unlock cantrip. While the caster speaks a word or phrase associated with locks (tick-tock-doublelock or yah-el, etc.) he or she makes a twisting motion with fingers held as if to grasp a key.

Creak 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
By means of this cantrip, the caster evokes a noise similar to that of a door with corroded hinges slowly opening, or else a sound as if someone or something were walking across squeaking floorboards. The former sound lasts for 1/3 segment; the latter noise will last half a segment and seem to traverse up to 10 feet distance. The caster makes a low creaking sound in his or her throat while using a hand to make an opening motion or fingers to make a walking motion.

Footfall 
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
When this cantrip is used, the caster creates the audial illusion of footsteps. The sound is as if a human or humanoid was walking. The footfalls can be soft or fairly noisy. They can approach, move away from, follow, or otherwise seem to parallel a person or party. They must begin within 1" of the caster, but they may thereafter move away from him or her up to a 2" distance, or may approach closer than 1". The caster must softly vocalize sounds similar to footsteps while pointing in the area they are to occur initially and subsequently. 

Groan 
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
A groan cantrip creates the audible illusion of a wracking cry coming from some location no more than 1" from the caster. Naturally, those creatures within hearing distance are allowed a saving throw versus spell, and if it succeeds, the individual will hear no such noise. The caster makes a soft groaning sound in his or her throat while pointing to the area from which the sound is to appear to come. A container or door will not hamper the range, so that a groaning sound can be made to seem to come from behind a door, in a chest, etc.

Moan 
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
This cantrip is the same as a groan cantrip, except that the sound involved is either a pitiful moaning or else an eerie one. The desired sound is either a low-pitched one for the haunting effect or a high pitched one for the pitiful effect.

Rattle
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
By means of this cantrip, the caster causes the audible illusion of a rattling sound associated with chains. Its direction and distance is the same as for a groan cantrip. The sound will last for up to 2 seconds. All creatures within 1" of the sound are entitled to a saving throw versus spell to determine whether they hear the illusionary sound. The spell caster names the rattling device which he or she desires to create the illusion of while shaking one hand vigorously.

Tap 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: 1 sq. ft.
By means of this cantrip, the caster is able to evoke an invisible force which will tap or rap against some solid object - a door, lid, floor, table, wall, pane, or whatever. The sound will occur once, twice, or thrice, according to the number of fingers extended by the caster. It is an actual sound; creatures within 1" of the noise will certainly hear it if they are able. Verbal component is a hollow sound created by the tongue against the palate, or a key phrase spoken softly, while the finger makes a tapping motion.

Thump 
(Illusion)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/10 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
An audible illusion, the thump cantrip causes all creatures within a 1" radius of the areaof effect to hear a loud but muffled thumping sound, as if something large just fell from a height of a foot or so. A successful saving throw versus spell nullifies the cantrip’s effect. The caster can cause the sound to seemingly come from any location within a 1" radius of his or her person. The caster swallows loudly while pointing toward the area where the cantrip is to come from, while thinking of the thumping sound.

Whistle 
(Evocation)
Level: 99        Components: V, S     Range: Unlimited        Casting Time: 1/6 segments       Duration: Permament        Saving Throw: None       Area of Effect: Special
When this cantrip is cast, the dweomer causes a faint or loud whistling sound. A faint whistling can be heard within 10', a loud one within 30’. The sound can be sharp and normal-seeming or echoing, hollow, and eerie. The caster must whistle softly in a manner similar to the desired sound while he or she looks at the area from which the sound is to come and holds two fingers near his or her mouth.
